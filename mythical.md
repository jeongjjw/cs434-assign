# Chapter 2: The Mythical Man-Month
---
## Delay? 
1. estimated poorly developed
2. confuse effort with progress.
3. Uncertain of estimates
4. Schedule progress is poorly monitored
5. Adding manpower to solve delayed schedule

## 1. Optimism
- everything will go well

## 2. Man-Month
- extra overhead such as training, communication time, sequential process

## 3. Estimates

## 4. Schedule
- 1/3 planning
- 1/6 coding 
- 1/4 componenet test and early system test
- 1/4 system test, all components in hand 

## 5. Reducing overhead example
- Using test
- First code review request: function specification
- Communicate through code review
- Make commit (pull request) small as possible
- Monitoring easier
